# CRYPTOGRAPHIC FAILURES
------------------------

* Introduction
--------------
Cryptographic Failures are a broad, wide-ranging class of vulnerabilities that relate to any instance where cryptography is used poorly, incorrectly, or not at all. While we don’t need to 
encrypt everything, it’s important that a user’s private sessions and data are protected in such a way that unauthorized users cannot access them.

Generally, this entails leveraging secure channels to transmit data (i.e., HTTPS instead of HTTP) and hashing/encrypting sensitive information at rest, all while leveraging best practices 
related to cryptography.

In many cases, this means we should use cryptographically secure functions (avoid deprecated or weak ciphers), ensure we are using secure keys when encrypting data (avoid using default or 
easily guessable credentials), ensure we are taking steps to protect hashed data (i.e., adding Salt to hashed data), and properly classifying data for the appropriate level of security 
(i.e., protecting sensitive information such as passwords).

In the following example, we’ll see what can happen if developers fail to implement proper cryptography by reviewing several code snippets and a sample database.
